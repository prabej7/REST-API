## üìú Introduction

Welcome to the REST API project repository! This project is a straightforward and efficient example of a RESTful API, implemented with Node.js and Express. It is designed to demonstrate basic principles and operations of RESTful services, focusing on simplicity and scalability.

## ‚ú® Features

- **CRUD Operations:** Perform Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations on various resources.
- **Simple Architecture:** Clean and understandable code structure.
- **Error Handling:** Consistent and meaningful error responses.
- **Modular Design:** Components are neatly organized to facilitate maintenance and scalability.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- **Node.js:** JavaScript runtime for building fast and scalable network applications.
- **Express:** Web framework for building robust APIs and web applications.
- **MongoDB:** NoSQL database for flexible and scalable data storage.
- **Mongoose:** ODM for MongoDB to manage data schemas.
- **dotenv:** Module for loading environment variables from a `.env` file.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- npm (Node Package Manager)
- MongoDB instance (local or cloud)

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/prabej7/REST-API.git
   cd REST-API
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables:**

   Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the following variables:

   ```plaintext
   PORT=5000
   MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
   ```

4. **Start the server:**

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   The API should now be running at `http://localhost:5000`.
